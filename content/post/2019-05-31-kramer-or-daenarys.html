<p>If you’ve used the internet this year, you’ve probably seen a chart like this:</p>

<p>Yes. People are naming their children after characters from Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Working from the ever-popular <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names">babynames dataset</a>, I wanted to see if people were naming their children after characters that are <em>truly</em> odd.</p>
<p>Are people naming their children Seven <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUdaWZ4FN0">like George wanted to in Seinfeld?</a> What about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493037/">Beans from Even Stevens,</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay">Phoebe from Friends?</a></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Lorelei, Gilmore Girls (2000 to 2007)</li>
<li>Phoebe, Friends (1994 to 2004)</li>
<li>Rory, Gilmore Girls (2000 to 2007)</li>
<li>Sheldon, Big Bang Theory (2007 to It Will Never End)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Big Bang Theory’s popularity spawned a prequel of a show inside of a show that is <strong>still running.</strong> I figured Sheldon would be a lot higher.</p>

<p>Yes… That <strong>Creed Bratton</strong> line is accurate! <br> Yes… People are really naming their children “Seven” even though George was never able to use it himself.</p>
<p>To further prove the point, here is the average number of names, per year, adjusted for the show’s time on television.</p>

<p>Maybe Creed was a popular name sometime long ago and it is <em>just now</em> coming back into style? <img src="/post/2019-05-31-kramer-or-daenarys_files/figure-html/Bonus%20Creed-1.png" width="672" /> To be fair, Creed was on the rise before The Office debuted in 2005; however, It’s safe to say that some were inspired by the character depicted on the show.</p>

<p>No one, and I mean no one, has named their child after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXOISYS5ubY&amp;t=29s">Beans</a>. When Shia LaBeouf made a movie of himself watching himself in all of the movies he has starred in, he cried <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXOISYS5ubY&amp;t=29s">in only one</a>.</p>
