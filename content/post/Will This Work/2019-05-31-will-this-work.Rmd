####This is an investigation into who dropped the glass this morning, why they did it, and how we can punish them. Also, I am learning Rmarkdown.  

![Our best detective is on the case thankfully.](/post/2019-05-31-will-this-work_files/bern.jpg){width=80% height=80%}

#####If the CHEENO REPORT has taught us absolutely anything, it is that you cannot trust anyone or anything. 

------------------------------------------------------------




```{r library load, include = FALSE, results=FALSE}
#You put your libraries at the top to make sure the chunks below do not throw errors. I could hide all of this with the echo turned off. 
library(nasaweather)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggvis)
```


It took awhile, but I got this plot to finally appear and I think it tells us **alot** about this morning if you *really* think about it. 
```{r first plot}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


I put *Bern* in italics because he is fancy and because he is **Innocent!** 
I put **Watch** in bold because he is a bold guy. 
I put [Rcub](jaguars.com) with this link becuase he is technological and likes the Jags. 
I put `Bern runs on R` in code because he is also full of techmology. 

####Who are the main suspects in the dropped glass case? I will make a bullet list. 
* Bern
* **Simon**
* Watch
* Gery

####Now let's put the suspects in order of who is the most likely culprit. 
1. Simon
2. Gary
3. Watch \(If he did it, it was likely by mistake.)\
4. Bern \(Even the investigators need to be investigated.)\

***

#####Now the following information might be too much for you to handle so be careful.

##**I think Simon is murdering the planet!**

The mean of all mpg listed in mtcars is `r mean(mtcars$mpg)` and that was a calculation only BERN could make. 

Now, check out what Simon drives:
```{r kable chunk, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:3, 1:2])
```

###This is truly disgusting! He is killing the planet!

***
Well, I think that about solves everything. Simon is murdering the planet and he continues to break your glasses.
