<p>It took awhile, but I got this plot to finally appear and I think it tells us <strong>alot</strong> about this morning if you <em>really</em> think about it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))</code></pre>

<p>I put <em>Bern</em> in italics because he is fancy and because he is <strong>Innocent!</strong> I put <strong>Watch</strong> in bold because he is a bold guy. I put <a href="jaguars.com">Rcub</a> with this link becuase he is technological and likes the Jags. I put <code>Bern runs on R</code> in code because he is also full of techmology.</p>

<h2><strong>I think Simon is murdering the planet!</strong></h2>
<p>The mean of all mpg listed in mtcars is 20.090625 and that was a calculation only BERN could make.</p>

<p>Well, I think that about solves everything. Simon is murdering the planet and he continues to break your glasses.</p>
