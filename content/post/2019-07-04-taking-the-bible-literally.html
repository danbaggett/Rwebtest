<p>I normally begin my American History Survey courses by asking students to give me a one sentence rundown of a particular era in History. The responses are a great way for me to quickly gauge if the material is sinking in.</p>
<p>The Great Depression?
Student: “FDR saved us from Hitler and the stock market.” (I have a lot of work to do.)</p>
<p>Reconstruction?
Student: “It was an attempt at putting the United States back together after the worst break up imaginable.” (I can work with this!)</p>
<p>The Reformation
Student: “Normal people were given access to the bible and chaos broke out.” (Yes)</p>
<p>The last one-line sentence is difficult for 21st century American students to understand.</p>
<p>The Reformation was <em>at least</em> a fight over the right to interpret. I was curious to see if the GSS survey contained any variables about the interpretation of the bible.</p>
<p>I think the intention of the GSS “bible” variable was to ilicit general feelings about the bible. I found the second part of their question much more interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>Which of these statements comes closest to describing your feelings about the Bible?<br />
A. The Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally, <strong>word for word</strong>.
B. The Bible is the inspired word of God <strong>but not everything in it should be taken literally, word for word</strong>.
C. The Bible is an ancient book of fables, legends, history, and moral precepts recorded by men.</p>
